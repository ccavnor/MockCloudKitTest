# ``MockCloudKitTestProject``

This is the test project that accompanies the [MockCloudKit framework](https://github.com/ccavnor/MockCloudKitFramework). The MockCloudKit framework is set up as a Swift Project Manager project, so can be imported via the URL of the project into your project, just as it is imported into this test project.

This project contains unit, integration, and UI tests for MockCloudKit project testing. Tests and code are well documented. Enjoy, and happy testing!
